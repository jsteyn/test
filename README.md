# Carpentries style lesson to Build a miniHPC for Training

The Carpentries Workbench won't work for me and since I do not have time to struggle with an infrastructure
that won't work I am just using GitHub pages (Jekyll) to create the lesson material.

If you want to work offline on this lesson, like me, you can install Jekyll by following the instructions on
the Jekyll site. There is a docker image but that also won't work for me.

If anyone would like to port this to the Workbench it would be great but I won't be able to work in the 
workbench until it takes less time to get it running than installing Jekyll (so 15 to 30 minutes).
