## Running the OS for the first time

Once you have written the operating system to the microSD card you can insert the card into 
the RPi and switch it on. If you configured the OS with a Wifi SSID and enabled ssh you 
should be able to access the RPi via the wireless network using your desktop or laptop computer.
