title: Introduction

When running a workshop to teach learners how to use an HPC, an instructor is
immediately presented with a few problems:

1. Very few users ever get to see an HPC in real life and it is left to 
imaginations and sci-fi movies to visualise what an HPC is. To many this is
quite a scary concept. 
1. Training on a "real" HPC can cause learners to be anxious that they might 
"break" something.
1. Access to an HPC needs to be arranged. This is not always a trivial task as
the use of HPC resources can be quite restricted in terms of who are allowed
to use a specific HPC. 
1. Workshop attendees often do not read their emails 
requesting them to create accounts before they turn up for the workshop which
results in instructors having to create accounts on the day. Apart from quite
often delaying the start of the workshop, it is also not always possible for 
instructors to create the user accounts on the day.
1. HPC resources are always in demand and running a workshop on a "real" HPC
takes resources away from "real" processes running at the time.
1. HPCs typically have to be connected to via the Internet. Any issues with 
accessing the Internet will affect the workshop.
1. If an HPC is heavily used or if someone runs a job on the login node, 
learners might not be able to log in or there are significant delays in getting
jobs into queues which again affects the timing of the workshop.

All these mentioned issues (and probably more) can be addressed by having a
dedicated HPC for training. But usually "real" HPCs are very expensive and it
wouldn't be feasible to purchase typical high-end HPC hardware just for a 
training setup. However, it is completely possible to use low-end hardware to
create a cluster that will run almost all the required software to learn how
to use an HPC.
